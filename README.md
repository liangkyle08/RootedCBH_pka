RootedCBh_pka is a repository for tools to run QM/ML (random forest) framework to accurately predict pKas of complex organic molecules using physics-based features from DFT and structural features from our CBH fragmentation protocol. Our model corrects the functional group specific deficiencies associated with DFT and achieves impressive accuracy on two extenrnal benchmark test sets, the SAMPL6 and Novartis datasets.

Example of RootedCBH fingerprint, where nitrogen is the site of protonation. Fragments in gray are either not present in the molecule or do not correspond to the fragment with the minimum path length.
